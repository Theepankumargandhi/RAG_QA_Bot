This is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** powered chatbot that allows you to upload any PDF document and ask natural language questions about it. It retrieves relevant document chunks using vector embeddings and responds using Cohere's `command-r` LLM model.

---

##  Features

- Upload any PDF and extract contextual answers
- Uses **Cohere** for embedding + generation (`command-r`)
- Stores vector embeddings in **Pinecone** for fast semantic retrieval
- Reranks results using `rerank-english-v2.0` for improved accuracy
- Streamlit interface with real-time chat

ðŸ”‘ API Keys Required
This project uses the following services:

Cohere API Key: For embedding, reranking and LLM generation

Pinecone API Key: For storing and querying document embeddings

You can get keys from:

https://dashboard.cohere.com

https://app.pinecone.io

These keys are securely entered through the Streamlit sidebar.

How It Works (RAG Flow)

Upload PDF â†’ text extracted via PyMuPDF

Text is split into chunks

Chunks are embedded using Cohere embed-english-v3.0

Stored in Pinecone vector DB

Ask question â†’ vector search â†’ top-k chunks retrieved

Results are reranked using rerank-english-v2.0

Final answer is generated via command-r using the top reranked chunks
