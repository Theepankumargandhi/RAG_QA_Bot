This is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** powered chatbot that allows you to upload any PDF document and ask natural language questions about it. It retrieves relevant document chunks using vector embeddings and responds using Cohere's `command-r` LLM model.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📄 Upload any PDF and extract contextual answers
- 🧠 Uses **Cohere** for embedding + generation (`command-r`)
- 📦 Stores vector embeddings in **Pinecone** for fast semantic retrieval
- ⚡ Reranks results using `rerank-english-v2.0` for improved accuracy
- 🎛️ Streamlit interface with real-time chat

🔑 API Keys Required
This project uses the following services:

Cohere API Key: For embedding, reranking and LLM generation

Pinecone API Key: For storing and querying document embeddings

You can get keys from:

https://dashboard.cohere.com

https://app.pinecone.io

These keys are securely entered through the Streamlit sidebar.

📚 How It Works (RAG Flow)
📄 Upload PDF → text extracted via PyMuPDF

✂️ Text is split into chunks

🔡 Chunks are embedded using Cohere embed-english-v3.0

💾 Stored in Pinecone vector DB

❓ Ask question → vector search → top-k chunks retrieved

🧠 Results are reranked using rerank-english-v2.0

🤖 Final answer is generated via command-r using the top reranked chunks
